## Agreements
All agents agree the root cause is a missing component file at the expected path. The module resolution system is working correctly -- it simply cannot find the file because it doesn't exist yet. High confidence across all analyses.

## Contradictions
The root cause agent suggests this might be a tsconfig misconfiguration, while the solution agent correctly identifies that the file simply hasn't been created yet. The evidence better supports the solution agent's position -- the path alias is standard Next.js configuration and is unlikely to be wrong.

## Gaps
No agent investigated:
1. Whether this is a shadcn/ui component that should have been installed via CLI
2. Whether other components have the same import pattern and work correctly (which would confirm the alias is fine)
3. Whether this is a recurring pattern -- are components being imported before creation regularly?

## Revised Assessment
Root cause (revised): The button component file does not exist. This is likely a scaffolding order issue where the import was written before the component was created, or shadcn/ui's button component was not installed.
Recommended fix (revised): Run `npx shadcn@latest add button` to install the missing component. If it's a custom component, create it at the expected path.
Priority (revised): P1 -- This blocks the build entirely and should be fixed immediately.
